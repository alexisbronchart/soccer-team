# SoccerTeam-RSCA

Demo app using SwiftUI & SwiftData to fetch and show soccer players.

## To run the app

This project requires Xcode 15 / iOS 17. I only tested it in Xcode 15.2.
Open the project and let SPM resolve the dependencies.
You'll probably have to update the dev team / bundle id to your own in "Signing & capabilities".
Try the favorite button on a real device :)
Alternatively you can also run this as a mac app, although the design probably still need some adaptations on that platform.
